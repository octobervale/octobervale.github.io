        I am a current student at Boise State in my sophomore year. I am enjoying my coursework in web design,
        animation, and unity.
    </p>
    <p>
        I enjoy spending time outside and sketching nature and cool architecture.

        I am a very passionate person, and I enjoy lots of different mediums, such as painting and traditional
        sketching, along with digital forms of art.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also love music, both playing it and listening! I try to spend plenty of time outdoors and in nature, to
        balance out my more indoor screen-based hobbies.
    </p>
    <p>
        I enjoy playing video games that let me express my creativity, like sandbox games, along with story-driven
        narratives.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm also an avid reader, and almost always have a book I'm currently reading.
